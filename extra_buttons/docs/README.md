## Formatting buttons {: .heading}

This add-on adds the following supplementary formatting buttons to Anki:

* a **code** button that will wrap selected text in a `<code>` (default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>). You can specify the CSS class you want to use in combination with `<code>`. For example, we have a CSS class named `c` defined in the *Styling* section of *Cards*:
{: .formatting-button #code-button}


        .c {
            font-family: droid sans mono;
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
            padding-left: 5px;
            padding-right: 5px;
        }

    In the options *Tools &gt; Supplementary buttons add-on (options) &gt; Alter
    &lt;code&gt; CSS...* we can specify the class name, so that our `<code>`
    elements will be automatically transformed to `<code class="c">`.

* an **unordered list** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #unordered-list-button}

    * One
    * Two
    * Three

* an **ordered list** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #ordered-list-button}

    1. One
    2. Two
    3. Three

* an **indent** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>]</kbd>) to indent text or lists:
{: .formatting-button #indent-button}

    1. One
        * Two
            1. Three

* an **outdent** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>[</kbd>) to outdent text or lists
{: .formatting-button #outdent-button}

* a **strikethrough** button (default <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>5</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #strikethrough-button}

    <del>strikethrough text example</del>

* a **code block** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>) that creates
    a `<pre>` block element around the selected element. This works the same way
    the code button works. You can specify the CSS class you want to use in
    combination with `&lt;pre&gt;` by going to *Tools &gt;
    Supplementary buttons add-on (options) &gt; Alter &lt;code&gt; CSS...*
{: .formatting-button #pre-button}

* a **horizontal rule** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>) that
    inserts a horizontal rule after the current position of the cursor
{: .formatting-button #horizontal-rule-button}

* a **definition list** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>D</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #definition-list-button}

    <dl><dt>definition term</dt><dd>definition description</dd>

    Upon clicking the button, a popup will appear where you can enter your terms
    and descriptions.

* a **table** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #table-button}

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>header</th>
                <th>header</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>content</td>
                <td>content</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    Select the text you want to create a table from. This works very much the
    same as a Markdown list:

        header1 | header2
        -|-
        elem1 | elem2

    This will create a list with two columns and two rows. The `-|-` part is
    optional, but can be used to align the column to the left (`:-`), right
    (`-:`) or to the center (`:-:`). You can skip this line completely, but do
    make sure you add a pipe character `|` between elements to designate
    a border.

    Alternatively, if you do not select any text, upon clicking the
    <kbd>Create a table</kbd> button you will be presented with a dialog
    window asking you to specify the number of rows and columns.

* a **keyboard key** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>K</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #keyboard-button}

    This will create a keyboard key, for example <kbd>Esc</kbd>. By itself,
    the text that is wrapped in `<kbd>` will not look any different from the
    rest of the text. You have to style it first by going to the *Styling*
    section of *Cards* and add CSS to your liking. For example:


        kbd {
            box-shadow: inset 0px 1px 0px 0px #ffffff;
            background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0.05, #f9f9f9), color-stop(1, #e9e9e9) );
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            border-radius: 5px;
            border: 1px solid #dcdcdc;
            display: inline-block;
            font-size: 0.8em;
            height: 30px;
            line-height: 30px;
            padding: 0px 10px;
            text-align: center;
            text-shadow: 1px 1px 0px #ffffff;
        }

* a **hyperlink** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #hyperlink-button}

    Upon pressing the button, you will be presented with a dialog window where
    you can enter both a link and text. To unlink a hyperlink, use the unlink
    button.

* a **text highlight** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>N</kbd> to select color, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>B</kbd> to apply it):
{: .formatting-button #highlight-button}

    Highlight your text with colors.

* a **blockquote** button (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>Y</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #blockquote-button}

    Cite your source distinctively from the rest of the text. You can add an
    author by putting brackets around the text:

        Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men. [[John F. Kennedy]]

    > Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men.<br />
    > _John F. Kennedy_

* **alignment** buttons:
{: .formatting-button #alignment-button}

    Align your text left, right, center or justified. Shortcuts are
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>,
    <kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd>, respectively.

* a **heading** button (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>):
{: .formatting-button #heading-button}

    You can either create a heading by prepending text with hashes: `#` for
    a `<h1>` heading, `######` for a `<h6>` heading. If you do not prepend any
    hashes, or if you select no text at all, a dialog will appear where you
    can create your own heading.

## Markdown {: .heading}

You can use Markdown to style your notes. Markdown is a text-to-HTML
conversion tool, that lets you quicky style your notes. If you don't know
Markdown yet, have a look at [this tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

When you click the Markdown button, your Markdown syntax will be translated
into HTML and displayed. You are now in _Markdown mode_. Markdown mode is
indicated by the changed background color and the warning message under the
field you are editing. In Markdown mode, you cannot use any of the formatting
buttons you would normally have access to. This is done to prevent any
accidental editing of the displayed result. If you want to make changes to the
card, first toggle the Markdown button again and go back to normal mode.

When you do add text to your card or alter the HTML directly in Markdown mode,
a dialog box will appear asking whether you want to revert to your previous
Markdown syntax, or try to incorperate the changes in your card. Be advised,
however, that the result may lose some of your original Markdown syntax,
especially if the original syntax was complex (footnotes, tables, code
blocks).

To make sure you always return to your original syntax when exiting Markdown
mode, you can check the _Always revert back automatically to old Markdown_
checkbox in the options. Doing this will never show you the warning dialog box
and will always discard any changes made in Markdown mode.

This addons supports some Markdown syntax not found in
[John Gruber's original
Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):

#### Code blocks {: .heading}
Code blocks can be created by indenting four spaces with a white line before
and after the code block. The syntax can be specified either by:

    :::java
    public class Test { }

or by using:

    ```python
    def print_me(this):
        print "Printing: ", this
    ```

More (technical) details on code blocks (e.g. highlighting of lines) can be
found on the
[Python Markdown project](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html).

#### Definition lists {: .heading}

A definition list can be created as follows:

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
    the family Rosaceae.

    Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

Make sure there is a white line between the different definitions.

#### Footnotes {: .heading}


    Footnotes[^1] have a label[^@#$%] and the footnote's content.

    [^1]: This is a footnote content.
    [^@#$%]: A footnote on the label: "@#$%".

A footnote label must start with a caret `^` and may contain any inline text
(including spaces) between a set of square brackets `[]`. Only the first caret
has any special meaning.

A footnote content must start with the label followed by a colon and at least
one space. The label used to define the content must exactly match the label
used in the body (including capitalization and white space). The content would
then follow the label either on the same line or on the next line. The content
may contain multiple lines, paragraphs, code blocks, blockquotes and most any
other markdown syntax. The additional lines must be indented one level (four
spaces or one tab).

More (technical) details on footnotes (e.g. multiple blocks of content) can be
found on the
[Python Markdown project](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html).

#### Abbreviations {: .heading}

The Markdown syntax:

    The HTML specification
    is maintained by the W3C.

    *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
    *[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium

will be rendered as:

    <p>The <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> specification
    is maintained by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>.</p>

#### Tables {: .heading}

Tables have the same syntax as described above for the table button. Tables
can be styled with CSS in your stylesheet.

#### Attributes {: .heading}

An example attribute list might look like this:

    {: #someid .someclass somekey='some value' }

A word which starts with a hash (`#`) will set the id of an element.

A word which starts with a dot (`.`) will be added to the list of classes
assigned to an element.

A key/value pair (`somekey='some value'`) will assign that pair to the element.

Be aware that while the dot syntax will add to a class, using key/value pairs
will always override the previously defined attribute. Consider the following:

    {: #id1 .class1 id=id2 class="class2 class3" .class4 }

The above example would result in the following attributes being defined:

    id="id2" class="class2 class3 class4"

Say you have a CSS class:

    .large { font-size: 32px; }

You can add this class to a paragraph like this:

    A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.
    {: .large}

More (technical) details on attributes (e.g. block-level and inline
attributes) can be found on the [Python Markdown
project](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/attr_list.html).

## Custom user-defined keybindings {: .heading}
You can change the default keybindings by editing the `keybinding.json` file in
your `Anki/addons/extra_buttons` folder.  Please keep in mind that there is no
check for duplicate keybindings. This means that when a keybinding is already
taken by either your OS, Anki, this addon, or some other running program, the
result is undefined.

This file needs to contain valid JSON. Basically this means that the key-value
pairs should be enclosed in double quotes:

    "key": "value"

The opening and closing braces in the file `{` and `}` are mandatory. Each
key-value pair should contain a colon `:` and should end with a comma, except
for the last pair. See the file for valid examples.

Invalid JSON cannot be parsed and will result in the use of the default
keybindings. If you find that your new keybindings don't work
(i.e. they don't show up in Anki, despite you changing this file),
please use a JSON validator to check for faulty JSON.

Modifier keys that can be used include: the function keys (`F1` through `F12`),
`Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, ASCII alphanumeric characters, and ASCII punctuation
characters. For Mac OS X, be advised that `Ctrl` maps to the <kbd>Cmd</kbd>
key (or "Apple key"), NOT to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. If you want to use the
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key on Mac OS X, use `Meta` instead. So, `Ctrl+Shift+[` on Linux
or Windows maps to `Meta+Shift+[` on Mac OS X. The string `Ctrl+Shift+[` on Mac
OS X will require you to type <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\[</kbd> in
Anki. Please make sure you understand this before opening bug reports.

The use of an invalid key sequence will silently revert the sequence to the
default setting. For example, invalid sequences are:

* only modifier keys: `Ctrl+Shift`
* empty sequence
* non-existing modifier keys: `Ctrl+Iota+j`

The order or case of the string sequence is unimportant. `Ctrl+Alt+p` is the
same as `ALT+CTRL+P` or even `p+Ctrl+Alt`.

If you want to revert your changes to the default keybindings provided by
Supplementary Buttons for Anki, please remove the keybindings JSON file in your
addon folder.
